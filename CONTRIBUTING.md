## 🚦 Before You Start

➡️ **Please create an issue first describing what you want to work on.**  
We’ll discuss it and assign it to you before you begin. This helps avoid duplicate efforts and keeps things organized.

Only after we assign the issue should you begin working and raise a pull request (PR).

## 🧼 Ground Rules

- Keep it minimal. We prefer subtraction over addition
- No analytics, tracking, or external storage libraries
- Avoid dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Dark/light mode support must be preserved
- Keep it frontend-only (no backend by design)

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` or `pnpm install`
3. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
